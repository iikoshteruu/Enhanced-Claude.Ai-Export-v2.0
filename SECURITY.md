## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Browser Environment
Enhanced Claude Export runs in your browser as a userscript and:

- **‚úÖ Stays Local**: All conversation data remains in your browser
- **‚úÖ No External Servers**: Does not send data to any external services
- **‚úÖ No Data Collection**: Does not collect or transmit personal information
- **‚úÖ Client-Side Only**: All processing happens locally on your device

### Data Handling
- **Conversation Export**: Exports are saved directly to your local device
- **No Cloud Storage**: Script does not automatically upload to cloud services
- **User Control**: You decide where and how to store exported conversations
- **Privacy First**: Your conversations remain private and under your control
